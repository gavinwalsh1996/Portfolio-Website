<h1>Inspiration</h1>

I was inspired to make this website by looking at many different developer's portfolios. I spent a lot of time looking at different features and ways to make the website easy to navigate for the hiring manager. I went for a simple one page website with a smooth scrolling feature to make it very user friendly.

<h1>Summary</h1>

With this design, I spent a lot of time planning the build and listing off all of the features that I would be using within the website. This saved me a lot of time when it came to the building process as I had a set plan to follow. I built this website within a couple of hours and learned a lot along the way.

I noticed that I was getting very comfortable building with React and was improving my skills at a very fast pace.
